# HTTP-Web-Server

This project uses Java paired with OOP to create a low-level HTTP web server. The goal of this project was to better understand how the HTTP works as well as it's limitations in both response time and security.

This project was developed by myself, Robert Clarkson.

To Run:
```
javac WebServer.java 
java WebServer
```
